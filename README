Some things to note when installing:

This script runs in python3, and is tested with python 3.6 or later.

There are several required Python modules that can be installed from
pip or through OS packages (these are listed in setup.py). The
corresponding Ubuntu packages are:
  - python3-lxml

You need a bunch of system dependencies for this to operate correctly.
In particular, you need the python bindings for cairo and the
introspection-based bindings for GObject (with the cairo hooks enabled).
On ubuntu, install these packages:
  - python3-cairo
  - python3-gi
  - python3-gi-cairo

Several libraries are used via the gobject-introspection based bindings.
The corresponding ubuntu packages to get these bindings are:
  - gir1.2-glib-2.0
  - gir1.2-poppler-0.18
  - gir1.2-gtk-3.0
  - gir1.2-gdkpixbuf-2.0
  - gir1.2-pango-1.0

Finally, you'll need ffmpeg (version 2.0 or newer) for the video
encoding to operate correctly. It's also helpful if you have the
Microsoft core fonts installed (or something metric-compatible with
appropriate aliases enabled), since the text annotations require Arial.
